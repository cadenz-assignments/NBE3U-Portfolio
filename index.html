                        This module was my introduction to HTML/CSS. I had a brief understanding what they were and what they were supposed to do, but never sat down and learned them. Web development was and still is fairly new to me. I have a lot more experience in developing websites now then I did at the start of the course. Both my personal projects and the khan academy helped me get into web development.

                    <p style="font-size: 1.6vw;">
                        I already had a brief understanding of javascript and how to code with it before the course, but it was not in depth. After this module I was able to understand the concept of prototypes, and other programming concepts and how to use them effectively in Javascript. This certainly helped in my web development journey.

                        This was one of the few modules that sparked my interest. I was able to learn quite a lot of about computer memory, the binary format and how to count in binary. This expanded my knowledge on binary and computer memory on top of my previous knowledge of them.
