                    <p>
                        This module was my introduction to HTML/CSS. I had a brief understanding what they were and what they were supposed to do, but never sat down and learned them. Web development was and still is fairly new to me. I have a lot more experience in developing websites now then I did at the start of the course. Both my personal projects and the khan academy helped me get into web development.

                    <p style="font-size: 1.6vw;">
                        I already had a brief understanding of javascript and how to code with it before the course, but it was not in depth. After this module I was able to understand the concept of prototypes, and other programming concepts and how to use them effectively in Javascript. This certainly helped in my web development journey.

                        This was one of the few modules that sparked my interest. I was able to learn quite a lot of about computer memory, the binary format and how to count in binary. This expanded my knowledge on binary and computer memory on top of my previous knowledge of them.

                        When I reached this module, I already had a decent understanding of Javascript. So I was able to quickly complete this module with no issue. This was mostly a practice module for me. It didn't teach me anything new to me, but it was able to reinforce some ideas and concepts.

                        This module was able to teach me how to use the parts of Github that I have not really touched on before, such as Github Pages, and PRs. It was also able to reinforce my ability to write vanilla HTML and Markdown.

                        In this module, I was able to explore git/github myself, and complete the learn git branching mini lesson. This was actually one of the most useful modules so far. I was unfimiliar with all the different things you can with Git Branching before this module. This module taught me different ways of branching, moving code, commiting code, and etc.

                        The Microbit module was exciting at the beginning. But the realization of it can not do all we wanted it to do at the beginning was slightly disappointing. Either way, it was able to teach me to look out for emerging technologies out there.

                        This module was fairly fun, since we were able to choose what we wanted to do. It was able to teach me the difficulty of working as a group with people of different skill sets. It was also able to teach me that when choosing projects to work on, a feasible option should be on the top of the list.

                    <p style="font-size: 1.5vw;">
                        The creative coding module was another relatively fun module. I especially found practical usage for the A* path finding algorithm in one of my personal projects - Ecosystem Simulation. It is explained in more detail in module 10. In this module I was actually able to learn a lot about algorithms and especially path finding algorithms.

                    <p>
                        The game jam was a fun module as well. I was able to create the prototype of a 2.5d voxel game. Although I thought I could create more than just a prototype if I had more time. Through this module, I was able to learn a lot about isometric perspective, procedural generation, and bezier curves. Generally speaking, I think this was one of the most benificial modules to me.

                    <p>
                        In my opinion this was the most benificial module of all. Since this is quite a large module, I have a <a href="projects.html">separate page</a> explaining each submodule in more detail.

                        I participated in my first public hackathon in April 2022. It is called Lyon Hacks II. It is a 48 hour hackathon, during it me and my friend were able to create <a href="https://github.com/W1nter-isHere/Liveline" target="_blank">Liveline</a>.
                        It is definately not complete, but it is use-able. It is a online interactive presentation tool. It allows a group of audience to join a "room" with a host and the host will be able to control, create slides. The slides will be updated realtime on the audiences' side as well.
                        In this module I was able to learn a lot about web-sockets and communication between web clients.
