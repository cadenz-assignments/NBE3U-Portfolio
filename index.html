                    I believe this piece is best representative of me as a learner because it showcases my ability to
                    use different media formats to effectively share ideas while incorporating the knowledge I gained
                    through research. Personally, I find it challenging to communicate my thoughts purely through
                    written text. That's also the reason why I've been using media formats throughout the
                    semester to complete my assignments.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I think by using various media forms, I've been able to leverage my strengths and present my work in
                    an engaging way. This assignment demonstrates not only my skills in creating media content but also
                    in creating a fluid experience by using animations, simplistic yet aesthetic art style and organized
                    information.

                    I think this piece also reflects my abilities and growth as a learner. In this video anthology, I
                    was able to creatively incorporating music, video, and personal analysis, and through it, I was able
                    to express my ideas in an engaging way
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One aspect I really like about this piece is how I used the fourth piece (the music) as a continuous
                    background throughout the video. This deliberate choice created a cohesive and immersive experience,
                    adding depth and ambiance to the overall presentation.

                    <br>
                    Additionally, the analysis and personal reflections I shared for each text demonstrated my critical
                    thinking skills. As I explored the poems, instrumental music, and novel, I
                    provided my own insights and interpretations. It was an opportunity for me to showcase my thought
                    process and demonstrate the meaningful connections I made.

                    This is the infographic I've created for Day 2 of the Cottagers and Indians play study. Initially, I
                    was dissatisfied with the first version of the infographic I created and submitted for feedback.
                    However, for the purpose of this
                    portfolio, I took the opportunity to completely remake it while considering the feedback I
                    received on the original product. I think that my efforts have paid off, as the revamped
                    infographic is now much more visually engaging and appealing compared to the original version.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    During the process of recreating the infographic, I made an effort to make the infographic more engaging
                    for the audience and more attention grabbing. For this reason, I included a big eye-catching number in the
                    font center of the infographic displaying some statistics. I think the new version really nicely presents
                    the organization. The new version also leaves out the less important parts of the information, making the
                    infographic less cluttered and easier to look at.

                    This experience of revisiting and improving upon my initial work demonstrates my dedication to
                    continuous learning and growth as a creator. By acknowledging and incorporating feedback, I was able
                    to enhance the quality and effectiveness of my infographic. This process showcases my ability to
                    adapt, learn from constructive criticism, and transform a project into a more polished and impactful
                    final product.
