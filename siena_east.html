                    Siena East has worked as an acting, directing assistant, model, and teacher's assistant in Digital
                    Art Creation and Music Video Creation at Marlborough School. She also worked as a substitute
                    teacher, post-production and office production assistant at Warner Bros. She is now working at FOX
                    Corporation as Executive Story Editor and Co-Producer.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In general, Siena East creates media content such as TV shows, short movies, and stand-up comedy
                    talk shows. More specifically, she has performed at various venues and events, including the
                    Hollywood improv, Association of American Indian Affairs, and Good Medicine at Oakland Museum.

                    <br>
                    Siena East is currently working as the Co-Producer at Fox Corporation, which is a fairly large
                    corporation with 9000 annual employees as of 2020. She is also part of a DND youtube channel named
                    NDND. It is created by a group of Indigenous DND players. This is a breath of fresh air to the DND
                    community, as most of them are not composed of a diverse group of players.

                    <br>
                    Even though Siena East does not state the reason why she is in the film making line of work, I
                    believe Siena East is doing it because she is passionate about her work. She has been creating media
                    since 2012.

                    Siena East seems really dedicated to what she does - creating media pieces including films, shows,
                    and performing. I watched some of the stand-up shows on her youtube channel and they were
                    entertaining. Also, as a DND player myself, her participation in DND interested me, and made me want
                    to learn more about what she does and who she is.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I believe that passionate work makes good work. If someone is passionate about what they do, they
                    can do a better job than someone who isn't passionate about their work. Siena East shows a
                    significant amount of passion in creating media pieces in the form of short films, writing, comedy,
                    etc. I believe that Indigenous writers are one of the most under-represented groups of writers
                    in modern TV/movie production and Siena East is a talented TV writer and has her own ideas.

                    Anyone who is interested in the entertainment industry, particularly in the field of writing,
                    comedy, and filmmaking. Additionally, those who are looking for Indigenous representation and
                    diversity.

                    <br>
                    Siena East is a talented Indigenous writer who is very creative and passionate about her work. This
                    is how she is capable of producing entertaining content.
